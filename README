# Mano Weavings Module for BrowserCMS

A module to allow Mano a Mano to sell Bolivian weavings on the internet.

## Installation
These instructions are adapted from those found at http://www.browsercms.org/doc/guides/html/installing_modules.html.

To install this module, do the following:

### A. Build and install the gem from source
This assumes you have the latest copy of the code from github on your machine.

        gem build bcms_mano_weavings.gemspec
        sudo gem install bcms_mano_weavings-1.0.0.gem

At this point, the Mano Weavings gem should be installed as a gem on your system, and can be added to your projects.

### B. Adding the Mano Weavings module to your project
In your BrowserCMS application, do the following steps.

#### 1. Edit the config/environment.rb file

		config.gem 'browsercms'

		# Add this next line after the browsercms gem
		config.gem 'bcms_mano_weavings'

#### 2. Edit the config/routes.rb file


		# Add this route. It must be before the core browser_cms route.
		map.routes_for_bcms_mano_weavings
		map.routes_for_browser_cms

#### 3. Install the new module code
From the root directory of your cms project, run:

		script/generate browser_cms

This will copy all the necessary views and migrations from the gems into your local project.
You should messages checking to see if files already exist or were created.

#### 4. Run migrations and start the server
This module will add new data types, like content blocks, so you need to run the migrations to add them to your project.

		rake db:migrate
		rake db:seed # Optionally create a weavings section and some pages
		script/server

#### 5. Installation Complete
* Open your browser to localhost:3000/cms/portlets and login


## Running cucumber scenarios and rspec examples (tests)
Cucumber and rspec are used to verify the behavior of the system.

#### 1. Run the default rake task
rake

#### 2. If there are problems delete the test db. This should not be needed every time because use_transactional_fixtures is used so the db is not modified
rm -f db/test.sqlite3
